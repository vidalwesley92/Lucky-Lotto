## Introduction

For this project, I've chosen to develop a lotto number generator called Lucky Lotto. The goal is to generate random numbers from 1 to 47 without repetition, allowing users to input some of the numbers if they wish. Immersing myself in the realm of JavaScript, I've eagerly embarked on this journey, driven by various motivations. As I navigate through the intricacies of coding, I'm filled with anticipation regarding the potential opportunities this venture might bring in the future. Additionally, this endeavor has not only deepened my understanding but also equipped me with new skills in HTML and CSS.
